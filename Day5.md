## Function 
A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. It is a fundamental building block of JavaScript programming and allows you to organize and encapsulate logic into reusable units.

A JavaScript function can be defined using the function keyword followed by the function name, a set of parentheses (), and a block of code enclosed in curly braces {}. 
``` javascript
function sum(num1 , num2){
  return num1 + num2;
}

```
We can also write variable hold function 
``` javascript
const sum = (num1 , num2) =>{
  return num1 + num2;
}
// This code work exactly the same from the upper one
```
