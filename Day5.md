## Function 
A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. It is a fundamental building block of JavaScript programming and allows you to organize and encapsulate logic into reusable units.

A JavaScript function can be defined using the function keyword followed by the function name, a set of parentheses (), and a block of code enclosed in curly braces {}.
