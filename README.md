# JavaScript-20DayJourney
# Learning JavaScript 


During my first 20 days of learning JavaScript on GitHub, I delved into a vast collection of repositories, tutorials, and discussions. I grasped the fundamentals, including variables, functions, loops, and conditionals. Engaging with the GitHub community, I collaborated on open-source projects, contributed to a JavaScript library, and learned the importance of documentation. These initial experiences expanded my skills, instilled confidence, and fueled my passion for JavaScript's potential. I'm excited to continue my journey on GitHub, transforming ideas into reality.

# Plan
In my first 20 days of learning JavaScript on GitHub, I accomplished the following:

Watched a 90-minute course on Frontend Masters: I dedicated time to immerse myself in a comprehensive course available on Frontend Masters, a platform known for its high-quality programming courses.

Summarized the course I watched: After completing the course, I took the initiative to summarize its key concepts and takeaways. This process allowed me to solidify my understanding of the material and have a quick reference for future use.

Solved problems Given By GSG Team: To reinforce my learning, I actively sought out coding challenges and problem-solving exercises. By tackling these problems, I honed my JavaScript skills, applied the concepts learned in the course, and developed my problem-solving abilities.

By combining these activities, I ensured a well-rounded learning experience that encompassed both theory and practical application. These efforts laid a strong foundation for my journey into JavaScript development on GitHub.
